I used Spring Boot to create this webservice and HolidayApi(https://holidayapi.com/) as a source of information about holidays. Free account in this api allow to check holidays only from last historical year (2019).
You can run application from command line, first go to main directory of project and then build by maven (mvn package), next run compiled jar by use command 'java -jar target/application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' or just use command 'mvn spring-boot:run'. 
The base url of this service is http://localhost:8080/next-holiday (if you run it locally with default port). You have to add mandatory query parameters, countries and date, e.g. http://localhost:8080/next-holiday?countries=pl,fr&date=2020-01-01. It's necessary to pass two country codes in one parameter separated by comma.
The key for this api is stored in application.yml file.
